	* tls.c: Change the ChannelHandler to be registered on the main
	channel as oppsed to the "parent", or superceeded, channel.  This
	is because the socket driver notifies the main channel, and there are
	times with the main channel gets closed, but the superceded one
	is not yet closed.  If the channel handler gets triggered in this
	half-open state it is associated with the superceeded channedl, but
	uses its private pointer to the main channel, which is mostly destroyed.
	* Eliminated the redundant call to Tcl_NotifyChannel from TlsWatchProc
