	* tlsBIO.c (BioWrite, BioRead): changed Tcl_Read/Write to
	Tcl_ReadRaw/TclWriteRaw.

	* tls.c: added use of Tcl_GetTopChannel after Tcl_GetChannel and
	got return value from Tcl_StackChannel.

	* tests/tlsIO.test: added some handshaking that shouldn't be
	necessary, but we crash otherwise (needs more testing).

	* tlsIO.c: added support for "corrected" stacked channels.  All
	the above channels are in TCL_CHANNEL_VERSION_2 #ifdefs.

	* Makefile.in: Fixed broken test target.

	* tlsInt.h: 
	* tls.c: Cleaned up declarations of Tls_Clean to avoid errors on
	Windows (lint).

	* tls.c, tlsIO.c:  Split Tls_Free into Tls_Clean, which does
	the SSL cleanup, and the Tcl_Free call.  It is important to shutdown
	the SSL state "synchronously" during a stacked flush.

	* tlsIO.c: Restored call to Tcl_NotifyChannel from ChannelHandler
	to ensure that events propagate from the lower driver.  This may
	result in an infinite loop in some cases, so this is not a total
	fix.  This may be sufficient for now, however. [Bug: 5623]

	* tlsIO.c: Restore the previous version.  Fixed the CloseProc so
	it unregisters the channel handler on the superceded channel
	instead of the upper channel. Also removed the call to
	Tcl_NotifyChannel in the ChannelHandler because this will result
	in an infinite loop if data is ever buffered in the BIO
	structure. [Bug: 5623]

2000-05-31  Brent Welch <welch@scriptics.com>

	* tls.c: Change the ChannelHandler to be registered on the main
	channel as oppsed to the "parent", or superceeded, channel.  This
	is because the socket driver notifies the main channel, and there
	are times with the main channel gets closed, but the superceded
	one is not yet closed.  If the channel handler gets triggered in
	this half-open state it is associated with the superceeded
	channedl, but uses its private pointer to the main channel, which
	is mostly destroyed.  Eliminated the redundant call to
	Tcl_NotifyChannel from TlsWatchProc. [Bug: 5623]
