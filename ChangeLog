2001-06-21  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* configure: added configure to CVS
	* configure.in: moved to patchlevel 1.4.1

	* Makefile.in: corrected 'dist' target

	* tests/certs/file.srl:
	* tests/certs/ca.pem:
	* tests/certs/client.key:
	* tests/certs/client.pem:
	* tests/certs/client.req:
	* tests/certs/privkey.pem:
	* tests/certs/server.key:
	* tests/certs/server.pem:
	* tests/certs/server.req:
	* tests/certs/cacert.pem: replaced by new ca.pem
	* tests/certs/skey.pem: replaced by new server.key
	* tests/certs/ckey.pem: replaced by new client.key
	* tests/certs/README.txt: new set of test certificates with some
	README info on their generation.

	* tests/ciphers.test: updated ciphers expected with default
	openssl build.

	* tests/tclIO.test: updated to use new names for certs/keys.

2001-03-14  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@gimlet.activestate.com>

	* tls.c (Tls_Init): add do/while for random number initialization
	to work around some OSes quirks.  (Ralph.Billes@teltech.com.au)

2000-09-07  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* tlsIO.c (Tls_ChannelType): set typeName field of channel type to
	"tls" (this got lost in move to dynamic version compatability
	checking).

2000-08-23  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	TLS 1.4 RELEASED

	* Makefile.in (dist): create dist target for archive distributions

	* tests/tlsIO.test (tlsIO-8.1): added a delay on the accept close
	to make the test work with OpenSSL on Windows (doesn't affect
	other builds).

	* tls.htm: updated with notes for 1.4.

2000-08-21  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* tests/tlsIO.test: require at least tls1.4 in test suite.

2000-08-18  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* tls.c (Tls_Init): added call to RAND_seed to seed the SSL random
	number generator.  Without this, OpenSSL 0.9.5 chokes, and in any
	case it is a big security hole to do without it.

	* configure.in (OPENSSL): added NO_IDEA and NO_RC5 defines by
	default when compiling with OpenSSL.

	* tlsInt.h: added err.h include

	* tlsBIO.c:
	* tlsIO.c: corrected pedantic cast errors.

2000-08-16  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* tests/ciphers.test: improved ability to change constraint
	setting for whether user compiled against RSA or OpenSSL libs.

	* tls.c (Tls_Init): corrected interpretation of version number
	(patchlevel and release/serial were swapped).

2000-08-15  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* README.txt: added notes about need to use 8.2.0+.

	* tlsInt.h:
	* tls.c:
	* tlsIO.c: corrected structure initialization to work when
	compiling with 8.2.  Now compiles with 8.2+ and tested to work
	with 8.2+ and dynamically adjust to the version of Tcl it was
	loaded into.  TLS will fail the test suite with Tcl 8.2-8.3.1.

	* tests/all.tcl: added catch around ::tcltest::normalizePath
	because it doesn't exist in pre-8.3 tcltest.

	* tests/simpleClient.tcl: 
	* tests/simpleServer.tcl: added simple client/server test scripts
	that use test certs and can do simple stress tests.

2000-08-14  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* tlsInt.h:
	* tlsIO.c:
	* tlsBIO.c:
	* tls.c: changed around to only working with 8.2.0+ (8.3.2+
	preferred), with runtime checks for pre- and post-io-rewrite.

	* tls.c (Tls_Init): changed it to require 8.3.2 when Tcl_InitStubs
	was called because we don't want people using TLS with the
	original stacked channel implementation.

2000-07-26  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* merged all changes from tls-1-3-io-rewrite back into main branch

	* tests/tlsIO.test: updated comments, fixed a pcCrash case that
	was due to debug assertion in Windows SSL.

	* tls.c (ImportObjCmd): removed unnecessary use of 'bio' arg.
	(Tls_Init): check return value of SSL_library_init.  Also lots of
	whitespace cleanup (more like Tcl Eng style guide), but not all
	code was cleaned up.

	* tlsBIO.c: minor whitespace cleanup

	* tlsIO.c: minor whitespace cleanup.
	(TlsInputProc, TlsOutputProc): Added ERR_clear_error before calls
	to BIO_read or BIO_write, because we could otherwise end up
	pulling an error off the stack that didn't belong to us.  Also
	cleanup up excessive use of gotos.

2000-07-20  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* tests/tlsIO.test: corrected various tests to be correct for TLS
	stacked channels (as opposed to the standard sockets the test
	suite was adopted from).  Key differences are that TLS cannot
	operate in one process without all channels being non-blocking, or
	the handshake will block, and handshaking must be forced in some
	cases.  Also, handshakes don't seem to complete unless the client
	has placed at least one byte for the server to read in the channel.

	* tests/remote.tcl: corrected the finding of tests certificates

	* tlsIO.c (TlsCloseProc): removed deleting of timer handler as
	that is handled by Tls_Clean.

	* tls.tcl (tls::_accept): corrected the internal _accept to
	trickle callback errors to the user.

	* Makefile.in: made the install-binaries target regenerate the
	pkgIndex.tcl correctly.  The test target probably shouldn't screw
	it up, but this is to be on the safe side.

2000-07-17  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* pkgIndex.tcl.in:
	* configure.in: updated version to 1.4

2000-07-13  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* tests/tlsIO.test: enabled tests 2.10, 7.[1245] (there is no 3),
	which now pass.  Added some comments to other failing tests.

2000-07-11  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* tlsIO.c: changed all the channel procs to start with Tls* for
	better parity when comparing with Transform channel procs.
	Rewrote TlsWatchProc, added TlsNotifyProc according to the new
	channel design, which also leaves TlsChannelHandler unused.

	* tlsBIO.c (BioCtrl): changed BIO_CTRL_FLUSH case to use
	Tcl_WriteRaw instead of Tcl_Flush (to operate on correct channel
	in the stack instead of starting at the top again).  Would
	otherwise cause a recursive stack bomb when implicit handshaking
	took effect.

	* tests/tlsIO.test: removed changes made to test suite (all tests
	that ran before now pass correctly), and changed some accept proc
	args to reflect that a sock is an arg, not a file.

2000-07-10  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* tlsBIO.c (BioWrite, BioRead): changed Tcl_Read/Write to
	Tcl_ReadRaw/TclWriteRaw.

	* tls.c: added use of Tcl_GetTopChannel after Tcl_GetChannel and
	got return value from Tcl_StackChannel.

	* tests/tlsIO.test: added some handshaking that shouldn't be
	necessary, but we crash otherwise (needs more testing).

	* tlsIO.c: added support for "corrected" stacked channels.  All
	the above channels are in TCL_CHANNEL_VERSION_2 #ifdefs.

2000-06-05  Scott Stanton  <stanton@ajubasolutions.com>

	* Makefile.in: Fixed broken test target.

	* tlsInt.h: 
	* tls.c: Cleaned up declarations of Tls_Clean to avoid errors on
	Windows (lint).

2000-06-05  Brent Welch <welch@ajubasolutions.com>

	* tls.c, tlsIO.c:  Split Tls_Free into Tls_Clean, which does
	the SSL cleanup, and the Tcl_Free call.  It is important to shutdown
	the SSL state "synchronously" during a stacked flush.

2000-06-01  Scott Stanton  <stanton@ajubasolutions.com>

	* tlsIO.c: Restored call to Tcl_NotifyChannel from ChannelHandler
	to ensure that events propagate from the lower driver.  This may
	result in an infinite loop in some cases, so this is not a total
	fix.  This may be sufficient for now, however. [Bug: 5623]

2000-06-01  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* tlsIO.c: Restore the previous version.  Fixed the CloseProc so
	it unregisters the channel handler on the superceded channel
	instead of the upper channel. Also removed the call to
	Tcl_NotifyChannel in the ChannelHandler because this will result
	in an infinite loop if data is ever buffered in the BIO
	structure. [Bug: 5623]

2000-05-31  Brent Welch <welch@scriptics.com>

	* tls.c: Change the ChannelHandler to be registered on the main
	channel as oppsed to the "parent", or superceeded, channel.  This
	is because the socket driver notifies the main channel, and there
	are times with the main channel gets closed, but the superceded
	one is not yet closed.  If the channel handler gets triggered in
	this half-open state it is associated with the superceeded
	channedl, but uses its private pointer to the main channel, which
	is mostly destroyed.  Eliminated the redundant call to
	Tcl_NotifyChannel from TlsWatchProc. [Bug: 5623]
